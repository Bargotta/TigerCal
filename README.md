# TigerCal
The current Princeton events page is pretty bland and has a very utilitarian feel. TigerCal aims to provide students with the information for all Princeton events with a much better interface and design. TigerCal also allows students to specifically search for certain events, which (I believe) is not possible on the current Princeton events page. 

I have started to implement the Google Calendar API in an effort to allow students to add the events to their Google Calendars; however, I have unfortunately not managed to fully finish this task. I was also envisioning a page where clubs could login to the application and upload pictures from previous events to the page to share with other students. However, I have not managed to fully implement this either into the app.
