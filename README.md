# TigerCal
The current Princeton events page is rather bland and has a very utilitarian feel. TigerCal aims to provide students with the information for all Princeton events, including student-ran events (which are not listed on the current Princeton events page), with a much better interface and design. TigerCal also allows students to specifically search for certain events, which (as far as I am aware) is not possible on the current Princeton events page. 

I currently need to finish integrating the Google Calendar API into TigerCal to allow students to add the events to their Google Calendars. Additionally, I am envisioning a page where on-campus clubs and a organizations can login to the web app and upload pictures from previous events to the page to share with other students.
